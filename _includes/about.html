              <br/>
                <p> I am a freshman at Stony Brook University studying computer science. I am interested in different areas of computer science including Human Computer Interaction and Cybersecurity. I have gained some skills from past research projects - the first regarding cloud server interference and the second on the application of graph theory on MRI imaging. <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/">the preview page</a>.
